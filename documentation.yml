      "Bot" is the helpful object that are given to event handlers. It contains information about the 
      request and lots helpful methods to complete the request.
      
      Bots have utilities to handle webhooks **WebHookHelpers**
      ```javascript
      mailbot.onCommand(function(bot) { // <-- This is the "bot"
        bot.webhook.quickReply("hi");
        bot.webhook.respond();
      });
      ```

      One of the webhook helpers lets you create a settings form. This is its own class: **SettingsPage**
      ```javascript
        const mySettingsPage = bot.webhook.settingsPage({
        namespace: "todo",
        title: "ToDo Settings",
        menuTitle: "To Do"
        });
      ```

      A MailBot is an instance of the **MailBots** class. This class exposes handlers
      that are used to respond to specific events. (See readme.md for more). 

      ```javascript
        var MailBots = require("mailbots");
        var mailbot = new MailBots({
          clientId: "foo",
          clientSecret: "bar"
        });

        mailbot.onCommand("hi", function(bot) {
          bot.webhook.quickReply("Hi back!");
          bot.webhook.respond();
        });

        mailbot.listen();
      ```
